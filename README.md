# Webscraping 100 Universities
A small project to learn webscraping.

The code reads the website, parses the html, extracts the data (university name and a link to the university) and displays it in a dataframe format. It uses the BeautifulSoup4 and Pandas Libraries.

The link to the website used: [Top-100-Universities](https://www.topuniversities.com/where-to-study/north-america/united-states/ranked-top-100-us-universities)
